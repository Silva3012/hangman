Hangman Game

Rules of the Game

Hangman is a word guessing game. Guess the word by input a letter using your keyboard and pressing Enter or click Guess.

The game starts with a blanked out word and a number of blanks that correspond to the number of letters in the word. The player(s) must guess letters one at a time, and each correct guess reveals the position of the guessed letter in the word. Incorrect guesses result in the drawing of a gallows and a hanged stick figure.

The game ends either when the word is guessed correctly, or when the stick figure is completed.
